      <description>Synthesized data from a variety of private and governmental resources to draw new and useful conclusions. Used pivoting, joining, and stacking to transform the data into a more helpful and informative structure. Created an interactive dashboard in Bokeh to allow the end-user to better interpret the results.  Click here to see the Bokeh plot

      <title>Neural Network Machine Learning: Predicting Bikeshare Availability in San Francisco</title>
      <link>https://dallinwitt.github.io/portfolio/post/sfo_bikeshare/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dallinwitt.github.io/portfolio/post/sfo_bikeshare/</guid>
      <description>Used data from the San Francisco MTA to train a neural network to predict the number of bikes available at a given station at a given time. Used Keras / TensorFlow to create the neural network and SQLite to manage the database. Employed a variety of tools to develop the best possible network, such as randomized search hyperparameter optimization, and k-fold cross validation to ensure statistically robust results.</description>

      <guid>https://dallinwitt.github.io/portfolio/post/covid_approval_ratings/</guid>
      <description>Used wine survey data from Morning Consult Intelligence and the New York Times Covid data repository to assess the impact that increases in infection and death rates have on the approval ratings of governors and senators. Plotted data using separate tools that were individually highly information dense and highly lay-readable.  Click here to see one of the Plotly diagrams

      <guid>https://dallinwitt.github.io/portfolio/post/slc_airport_ml/</guid>
      <description>Analyzed multiple ML models and ensembles to find the strongest prediction tool for the task. Iterated over several hyperparameters to find the values that resulted in the strongest predictive power. The final model had a precision of 73% for on time flights, and 69% for late flights.

      <guid>https://dallinwitt.github.io/portfolio/post/ut_ed_attainment/</guid>
      <description>Used data from the Utah state government&amp;rsquo;s open data catalog. Used tools such as pivoting, stacking, and merging to transform the highly untidy dataset into something that could be used for meaningful insights. Merged the dataset with a GEOJSON file to assign geolocation information to each datum. Visualized the cleaned-up data in a Tableau dashboard, where users can interact with the visualization to extract further insight and information.</description>
